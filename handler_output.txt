WORKFLOW SELF-REPAIR ANALYSIS
================================

Run ID: 18355292276
Workflow: Crypto Prices
Status: FIXED âœ…

ROOT CAUSE
----------
1. Missing permission: Workflow needs `id-token: write` for OIDC authentication
2. Invalid parameter: Using `mcp_config` instead of `settings` for MCP configuration

WHAT WAS BROKEN
---------------
- The claude-code-action@v1 couldn't authenticate with GitHub (missing id-token permission)
- The action rejected the `mcp_config` parameter as invalid

ERROR MESSAGES FROM RUN 18355292276
------------------------------------
"Failed to setup GitHub token: Error: Could not fetch an OIDC token.
Did you remember to add `id-token: write` to your workflow permissions?"

"Unexpected input(s) 'mcp_config', valid inputs are [...'settings'...]"

HOW IT WAS FIXED
----------------
Applied fixes to .github/workflows/crypto-prices.yml:

1. Added `id-token: write` to permissions section (line 10)
   - This allows the action to obtain OIDC tokens for GitHub authentication

2. Changed `mcp_config:` to `settings:` (line 27)
   - The correct parameter name for MCP server configuration is `settings`

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
The claude-code-action@v1 requires one of:
- OIDC token (requires id-token: write permission)
- Explicit github_token parameter
- Custom GitHub App token

The workflow was using the default OIDC authentication but lacked the required permission.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration must be passed via the `settings`
parameter, which accepts a JSON configuration object with an `mcpServers` key.

NEXT STEPS
----------
The fix has been applied to crypto-prices.yml. The workflow should now:
1. Successfully authenticate with GitHub via OIDC
2. Load the CoinGecko MCP server configuration
3. Fetch cryptocurrency data for BTC, ETH, SOL, and HNT
4. Save results to data/crypto-prices.json
5. Commit changes automatically

Test with: gh workflow run crypto-prices.yml
