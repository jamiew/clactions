    prompt = f"""Analyze the workflow changes below (individual commit diffs from the last 8 hours).

Create a comprehensive changelog with the following structure:

## Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of what changed overall]

## Key Changes
- [Bullet point highlighting most important change]
- [Another important change]
- [3-5 key changes total]

## Changes by Commit

For each commit in the diff, create an entry like:

### [`short-hash`](https://github.com/jamiew/clactions/commit/FULL_HASH) - Commit Subject
*Author Name, Commit Date*

**Summary:** [1-2 sentence description of what this commit does]

**Changes:**
- [Specific change 1 - be concrete about files and functionality]
- [Specific change 2]
- [etc]

<details><summary>Full commit message</summary>

```
[Include the full commit message if it has useful detail beyond the subject]
```
</details>

---

Be specific about:
- Which workflow files were modified
- What functionality changed (new jobs, changed schedules, different permissions, etc.)
- Why the change matters (if obvious from commit message or diff)
- Breaking changes or important behavioral changes

Focus on being informative for a downstream system that might be affected by these changes.
Do not include the raw diffs in the changelog - only your analysis.

Here are the commit diffs:

Create a comprehensive changelog with this structure:

## üîÑ Workflow Changelog

### Summary
[2-4 sentences describing the overall theme of changes - e.g., "Major refactoring of data workflows", "New features added for X", "Bug fixes and performance improvements", etc.]

### Highlights
- ‚ú® [Most important new feature or change]
- üîß [Important fix or improvement]
- üèóÔ∏è [Architectural or structural change]
- [2-5 highlights total, use emojis to categorize: ‚ú® feature, üîß fix, üèóÔ∏è refactor, üìù docs, ‚ö° perf, üîí security]

### What Changed

#### New Workflows
- **workflow-name.yml** - [What it does and why it was added]
[Only include if new workflows were added]

#### Modified Workflows
For each modified workflow file:

**`workflow-name.yml`**
- [Specific change with impact - e.g., "Changed schedule from hourly to every 8 hours to reduce API usage"]
- [Another specific change]
- [Be concrete about what changed and why it matters]

#### Removed Workflows
- **old-workflow.yml** - [What it did and why it was removed]
[Only include if workflows were removed]

### Impact Assessment
[1-2 paragraphs describing potential impacts on downstream systems, APIs, documentation, or dependencies]

### Technical Details

Guidelines:
- Look at the unified diff to understand the net effect of all changes
- Focus on functional changes, not just file renames (but do mention significant renames)
- Identify patterns across multiple changes (e.g., "All data workflows now use commit-fetch-rebase-push pattern")
- Call out breaking changes or important behavioral changes
- Be specific about schedule changes, permission changes, new dependencies, etc.
- Group related changes together
- Write for an audience that needs to understand downstream impacts

Do NOT include raw diffs in the main changelog body.
