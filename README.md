we'd like to use Claude Code + GitHub Actions to make a website that we can automatically update via GitHub cronjobs that go check other things and then make updates to the website, like a lofi GitHub-powered automaton

we also want to demo e.g. updating code and then updating website correspondingly

similarly can we update something here and then submit a PR to a different repository?

lastly, create a GitHub Action that also uses some demo MCP servers, and perhaps we'll wire ourselves up to some external datasome demo MCP servers, and perhaps we'll wire ourselves up to some external data
