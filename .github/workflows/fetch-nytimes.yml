            Fetch the latest headlines from NY Times (https://www.nytimes.com/).

            Tasks:
            1. Scrape the NY Times homepage for top headlines
            2. Extract 10-15 of the most prominent headlines WITH their article URLs
            3. Update data.json with the headlines in the `nytimes_headlines` field as an array of objects with {title, url} structure
            4. Update the `last_updated` timestamp
            5. Commit and push the changes directly to main branch (use git push)

            Important: Each headline should be an object like: {"title": "Headline text", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/article-path"}
            Use web scraping or the WebFetch tool to get the content.
            Make sure to extract meaningful, current headlines with their full URLs.
