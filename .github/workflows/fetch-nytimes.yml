            Fetch the latest headlines from NY Times (https://www.nytimes.com/).

            Tasks:
            1. Scrape the NY Times homepage for top headlines
            2. Extract 10-15 of the most prominent headlines WITH their article URLs
            3. Create/update data/nytimes.json with this structure:
               {
                 "headlines": [
                   {"title": "Headline text", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/article-path"},
                   ...
                 ],
                 "last_updated": "ISO timestamp"
               }
            4. Commit and push the changes directly to main branch (use git push)

            Important:
            - Make sure data/ directory exists (create if needed)
            - Each headline must be an object with both title and url fields
            - Use web scraping or the WebFetch tool to get the content
            - Extract meaningful, current headlines with their full URLs
