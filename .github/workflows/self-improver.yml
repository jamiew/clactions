            ðŸ”§ **CLAUDE CODE SELF-IMPROVEMENT MODE**

            Your job is to analyze recent changes and improve the Claude Code setup in this repository.

            **Focus Areas:**
            - `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude Code working in this repo
            - `.claude/commands/` - Custom slash commands
            - `.claude/subagents/` - Subagent documentation
            - Workflow patterns and best practices

            **Context Files:**
            - `recent_prs.json` - Last 15 merged PRs with comments
            - `recent_issues.json` - Last 15 issues with comments and labels
            - `trigger_issue.json` - If triggered by issue comment, the specific issue

            **Your Task:**

            1. **Analyze Recent Activity**:
               - Read all context files to understand recent changes
               - Look for patterns in merged PRs - new workflows? new features? bug fixes?
               - Check issue comments for user requests about:
                 * "Update Claude rules"
                 * "Add to CLAUDE.md"
                 * "DRY this up"
                 * "Make this a pattern"
                 * Confusion about how Claude should work
               - Identify repeated patterns that should be documented
               - Look for workarounds that became standard practice

            2. **Review Current Claude Setup**:
               - Read `CLAUDE.md`
               - Check `.claude/commands/` for existing slash commands
               - Check `.claude/subagents/` for subagent docs
               - Identify what's outdated or missing

            3. **Look for Improvement Signals**:
               - User explicitly mentions updating Claude instructions
               - Same pattern appears in multiple PRs (should be documented)
               - Workarounds mentioned in comments (might need better approach)
               - New workflow types added (should update Quick Commands)
               - Debug patterns that worked (add to troubleshooting)
               - Tool usage patterns (update allowed tools guidance)

            4. **Make Strategic Improvements**:

               **CLAUDE.md updates:**
               - Add new workflow patterns discovered
               - Update Quick Commands with new workflows
               - Add troubleshooting tips from resolved issues
               - Document new architectural patterns
               - Update tool allowlists if patterns changed
               - Add examples of successful approaches

               **Slash Commands (.claude/commands/):**
               - Create new commands for repeated tasks
               - Update existing commands with better patterns
               - Remove obsolete commands

               **Subagents (.claude/subagents/):**
               - Add documentation for new subagent patterns
               - Update existing subagent docs with learnings

               **Consolidation & DRYing:**
               - If multiple PRs used similar prompts, extract to reusable pattern
               - If workflows have similar structures, document the template
               - If repeated instructions appear, add to CLAUDE.md

            5. **Create PR with Changes**:
               - Only create PR if you find meaningful improvements
               - If Claude setup is already optimal, exit without PR
               - PR title: "ðŸ”§ Self-Improve: Update Claude Code setup based on learnings"
               - Include clear summary of what changed and why
               - Reference specific PRs/issues that inspired changes

            **Quality Guidelines:**
            - Be conservative - only add patterns that appear multiple times
            - Don't remove existing guidance unless clearly obsolete
            - Keep CLAUDE.md concise and actionable
            - Examples should be real patterns from this repo
            - Focus on what helps Claude work better in THIS codebase

            **Don't Create a PR If:**
            - No clear patterns emerged from recent activity
            - Changes would be purely cosmetic
            - Current setup is already handling things well
            - Not enough evidence for new patterns

            **Strong Signals to Act:**
            - User explicitly said "add this to CLAUDE.md"
            - User mentioned "update Claude rules"
            - User said "DRY this up" or "make this a pattern"
            - Same workflow debug steps appeared 3+ times
            - New workflow category was added
            - Multiple PRs solved same problem differently

            Let's make Claude Code work even better! ðŸš€
