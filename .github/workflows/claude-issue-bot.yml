            An issue needs your attention!

            **Issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}**: ${{ github.event.issue.title }}

            **Description:**
            ${{ github.event.issue.body }}

            ${{ github.event.comment.body && format('**Comment:**
            {0}', github.event.comment.body) || '' }}

            **Your Task:**

            1. **Understand the request** - What is being asked?

            2. **Implement it** - Actually write the code, fix the bug, add the feature, etc.

            3. **Create a PR** - Make your changes and create a pull request
               - Reference the issue in PR body: "Fixes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
               - Include clear description of what you did
               - Make sure code works and follows existing patterns

            4. **Comment on issue** - Let them know you've created a PR

            **Important:**
            - Actually implement the solution, don't just plan it
            - Create a real PR with working code
            - Be autonomous - don't ask for clarification unless truly necessary
            - If the request is unclear or impossible, comment on the issue explaining why

            This is full autonomy mode - make it happen! ðŸš€
